## About The Project

This application was built by myself without any help from anyone else besides looking up example uses of CSS. I built this app to learn how to use props and array mapping in React. I'm still finding that I prefer statically typed languages over JS however, I hope that when I start using React Native, I can improve my experience by also using TypeScript.

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
